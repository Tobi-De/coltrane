# Serve

## Local development

`poetry run coltrane play` will serve the markdown files for local development. More details with the [CLI](static/cli).

```{warning}
`poetry run coltrane play` or Django's `runserver` management command is fine for local developement, but should never be used in production.
```

## Gunicorn

Coming soon.
