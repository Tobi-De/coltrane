# Introduction

`coltrane` is a [**Dynamic Site Generator**](index.md#what-is-a-dynamic-site-generator) that harnesses the power of `Django` without the hassle. It can also be used to build a static HTML site or as a third-party `Django` app.

## ‚≠ê Features

- Render `markdown` files as HTML with automatic URL routing based on the filesystem
- Use JSON files as data sources in content
- Automatic generation of `sitemap.xml` and `rss.xml` files
- Can also serve non-markdown files like `robots.txt`
- Local development server with live re-rendering of markdown and data
- Deployment best practices with `whitenoise` and `gunicorn` already configured
- Leverage custom or built-in `Django` template tags and filters
- Include any third-party [`Django` app](https://djangopackages.org) for additional functionality
- Optional building of static HTML files

## What is a Dynamic Site Generator?

`coltrane` is similar to a static site generator -- it takes `markdown` content and renders it as HTML. However, it also provides an opinionated framework for building dynamic websites.

## üéµ What's with the name?

`coltrane` is built on top of the `Django` web framework, which is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt). This framework is named after [John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane), another (more avant-garde üé∂) jazz musician.
