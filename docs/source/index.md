# Introduction

`coltrane` is a content site framework that harnesses the power of Django without the hassle. It can be used to generate a static site for easy serving of HTML files or as an opinionated Django package to render markdown.

## Features

- Can either generate static HTML, be used as a standalone Django site, or integrated into an existing Django site
- Can use data from JSON files in templates and content
- All the power of Django templates, template tags, and filters
- Renders markdown files automatically (for a standalone site)
- Can include other Django apps

Still a little experimental. ;)

## Installation

Because `coltrane` can be used in a few different ways, the documentation is split into different pieces depending on the desired outcome.

- Markdown is rendered into HTML and output to a folder on disk with a [static site](static/index)
- Django dynamically renders markdown from a [simplified standalone Django project](standalone/index)
- Django dynamically renders markdown [from within an existing Django project](integrated/index)

## What's with the name?

`coltrane` is built on top of the Django web framework, which is named after [Django Reinhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_Reinhardt). Following in that tradition, I named this static site framework after [John Coltrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane), another jazz musician.
